# Ensemble_methods
Data Background
The credit dataset contains 1,000 loan examples, with a mix of numeric and categorical features describing the loan details and the characteristics of the applicants. The dataset includes a class variable that indicates whether a loan went into default.

Steps to Follow:
1.	Data Preprocessing:
o	Apply label encoding to both predictor and target variables.
o	Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2.	Building the Model:
o	Construct a decision tree model using the credit dataset.
3.	Cross-Validation:
o	Perform cross-validation to ensure reliable predictions from the model.
4.	Enhancing Model Performance:
o	Improve the model using ensemble methods such as:
	Bagging
	Boosting
	Random Forest
5.	Parameter Tuning:
o	Use Grid Search to fine-tune the hyperparameters for optimal performance.
6.	Model Evaluation:
o	Evaluate each model’s performance using the ROC curve and AUC (Area Under the Curve).
Key Skills Demonstrated:
1.	Data preprocessing (label encoding, train-test split).
2.	Building and fine-tuning decision tree models.
3.	Using ensemble methods to improve model accuracy.
4.	Evaluating and interpreting model performance with metrics like ROC and AUC.
Tools Required:
•	Pandas: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
•	Scikit-learn: For building decision tree models, ensemble methods, and evaluating model performance.
